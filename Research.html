<h3>Industrial Research</h3>
<p>My industrial research work has been a continuation of and a massive extension of
what I got to do during my Phd - Esp. in the context of scaling prototypes and
models to production scale quality. Recommendation Systems, Scaling neural networks through hashing,
Anomaly Detection are some of the customer driven applications I have gotten to tackle while at work.
See more on Phd research below. </p>
<h3>Phd Research </h3>
<p>During my Phd, I worked in the areas of Optimization Theory, Compressed Sensing, Parsimonious
modeling and Rank approximation problems. This included matrix rank minimization, low-rank + sparse
decomposition problems and non-negative matrix factorization problems. </p>
<h3>Phd Research Applications</h3>
<p>My research interests took me to applications such as, &ldquo;How do you best recommend movies or products
to customers?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are some genes that mutate in correlation with disease conditions such as cancer?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What are the common mathematical under-pinnings behind these seemingly diverse problems?&rdquo;</p>

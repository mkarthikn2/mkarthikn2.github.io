<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I graduated with a PhD in Electrical Engineering from <br />
<a href="http://washington.edu">University of Washington, Seattle</a> in 2014<br />
and was advised by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/mfazel">Dr. Maryam Fazel</a>. <br />
I also obtained a masters degree in 2013 from the same university. <br />
Long before that, I obtained a dual degree in infrastructure engineering from IIT Madras. <br />
Currently, I am a Machine Learning Scientist with  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/">AWS ML.</a></p>
<h2>Prior work and interests</h2>
<p>I am broadly interested in bringing scalable ML solutions to concrete problems that address
pain points of customers/stake holders. <br /> Some problem spaces I have worked on in the past include 
deep learning models for recommender systems, <br /> diverse recommendation carousels for increasing product selection,
time-series anamoly detection and <br /> feature hashing for scaling neural networks. <br /> 
I have also worked on techniques for dimensionality reduction in the context of similarity search and feature selection. </p>
<h2>Employment</h2>
<p>2009 - 2014 - Phd, EE, UW <br />
2011 - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/careers/">Microsoft Research Intern</a> <br />
2015 - 2017 - Research Scientist, Amazon <br />
2016 - ML Lecturer for a 6 weeks course <br />
2017 - ML Lecturer for a 6 weeks course <br />
2017 - Present - Machine Learning Scientist, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/">AWS ML</a></p>
<h2>Publications</h2>
<p>For a detailed list of publications, please refer to my 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S0Cu-OsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">google scholar profile.</a></p>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>I have recently started writing publicly some code blurbs for small pet projects. You can check
some of the code <a href="https://github.com/mkarthikn2/projectEuler">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Teaching/Mentoring</h2>
<p>During my Phd, I have had the opportunity to mentor junior grad students and also TA many classes.
I feel priviledged to be able to continue the mentoring through teaching Machine Learning courses internally
at Amazon. I have designed and taught courses from scratch on <i>Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning</i>
and <i>Matrix Factorization and Dimensionality Reduction</i>. On the mentoring front, I have got the opportunity 
to mentor many SDEs transitioning to the role of scientists and also a few fellow junior scientists.</p>
